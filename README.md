# Sign Language Recognition Project

This project aims to recognize sign language gestures using deep learning techniques, providing real-time translation for users.

## Overview

This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to construct robust models capable of recognizing sign language gestures. We have also implemented a Flask API hosted on the cloud to process input, ensuring real-time translation and minimizing latency. Additionally, we have developed an Android application to deliver real-time translation to users on their mobile devices.

## Features

- Sign Language Recognition: The core feature of this project is the ability to recognize sign language gestures accurately.
- Real-time Translation: Leveraging the Flask API, the system provides real-time translation of sign language gestures into text.
- Cloud Hosting: The Flask API is hosted on the cloud, ensuring scalability and availability.
- Mobile Application: The Android application allows users to receive real-time translations directly on their mobile devices.
